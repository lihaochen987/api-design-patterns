# ADR explanation

## Status

ADR has been ripped out from the decision record template by Miachael Nygard. The only difference made is in the Status
section, where instead of Status denoting whether the decision has been accepted or not. The following are the valid
status:

- **Trialing** : Used for ADRs currently being implemented on a small scale or in a controlled environment to gather
  initial feedback.
- **Successful Trial / Recommended** : The experiment yielded positive results, and the approach is recommended for
  wider adoption or further refinement.
- **Partial Success / Conditional Recommendation** : Mixed results where some parts of the approach worked, but others
  need tweaking. Suitable when recommending partial adoption or limited usage.
- **Rejected** : Used for approaches that didn't meet expectations or introduced unforeseen complications. Often
  includes notes on why it was rejected.
- **Archived / Deprecated** : Useful for experiments no longer considered relevant due to newer findings or approaches.
